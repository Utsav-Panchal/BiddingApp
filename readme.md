Ok, I will tell you what I want for my web app. Remember all the APIs that we created in Node.js. I am giving you the pages and points that I want to create, as shown below:
Example Structure
+ for Bidding App Header/Navigation Bar:
 - For admin:
    Admin Dashboard, which includes Products(to create, delete and Update products), Monitopr Bids (Create, Update and Delete), Can register new admin, Login, Register, Home(Showing latest bid happened by all Users for all Products filtered by latest).
 - For User:
    Home(available products to bid), Winner List, Bids(done by user), Login, Register


Home page:
    For Admin: Will see latest bids happened by users. (Filter by username, product name)
    For User:  Will See Latest Products available to bid (Filter by Highest and lowest bid)

Product page: 
    For Admin - CRUD product, List Of Products (Filter by username, product name)
    
Bids Page:
    For Admin - List of Bids by User according the Product, (Can remove, Update, delete bid by user)
    For User - List of bids are done by user.

Winners:

    User -  Can See all winners according to products
